7/1/2014,Spin-lasers: From threshold reduction to large-signal analysis,journal_articles,Applied Physics Letters,"We explore the theoretical effects of leveraging the properties of electron spin in lasers, demonstrating improvements over conventional counterparts.","Jeongsu Lee, Sean Bearden, <b>Evan Wasner</b>, and Igor Zutic. 2014. ""Spin-lasers: From threshold reduction to large-signal analysis."" <i>Applied Physics Letters</i>. 105 (4): 042411.",spin-lasers-threshold-reduction,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4892071,,"Lasers in which spin-polarized carriers are injected provide paths to different practical room temperature spintronic devices, not limited to magnetoresistive effects. Unlike the conventional understanding of spintronic devices, an optimal performance of such spin-lasers can arise for finite, not infinite, spin relaxation time. By considering spin-relaxation times of both electrons and holes, we elucidate advantages of spin-lasers over their conventional (spin-unpolarized) counterparts. In addition to the steady-state threshold reduction, spin-lasers can improve transient operation leading to shorter turn-on delay times, reduced ringing of emitted light, and an enhanced bandwidth."

""Digital operation and eye diagrams in spin-lasers."" <i>Applied Physics Letters</i>. 107 (8): 082406.",spin-lasers-digital-operation,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4929612,,"Digital operation of lasers with injected spin-polarized carriers provides an improved operation over their conventional counterparts with spin-unpolarized carriers. Such spin-lasers can attain much higher bit rates, crucial for optical communication systems. The overall quality of a digital signal in these two types of lasers is compared using eye diagrams and quantified by improved Q-factors and bit-error-rates in spin-lasers. Surprisingly, an optimal performance of spin-lasers requires finite, not infinite, spin-relaxation times, giving a guidance for the design of future spin-lasers."
11/12/2022,"World Profit Rates, 1960-2019",journal_articles,Review of Political Economy,"We present estimates of industry-, national-, and world-level profit rates.","Basu, Deepankar, Julio Huato, Jesus Lara Jauregui, and <b>Evan Wasner</b>. 2022. “World Profit Rates, 1960–2019.” <i>Review of Political Economy</i> 37 (1): 92–107. doi:10.1080/09538259.2022.2140007.",world-profit-rates,https://doi.org/10.1080/09538259.2022.2140007,,"In this paper we present estimates of the world (net) profit rate using country-level data from the Extended Penn World Table 7.0 and estimates of the world (gross) profit rate using industry-level data from the World Input Output Database. The country-aggregated world profit rate series spans the period from 1960 to 2019, and the industry-aggregated world profit rate series runs from 2000 to 2014. The country-aggregated world profit rate series displays a strong negative linear trend for the period 1960–1980 and a weaker negative linear trend from 1980 to 2019. A medium run decomposition analysis reveals that the decline in the world profit rate is driven by a decline in the output-capital ratio. The industry-aggregated world profit rate shows a negative linear trend for the period 2000–2014, which, once again, is driven by a fall in the output-capital ratio. We have created a World Profitability Dashboard to allow researchers to freely access the world profit rate series and the underlying data at country, industry, country-group and world levels of aggregation."
4/14/2023,"Sellers’ inflation, profits and conflict: why can large firms hike prices in an emergency?",journal_articles,Review of Keynesian Economics,We analyze the pandemic-era inflation from an institutionalist perspective.,"Weber, Isabella M., and <b>Evan Wasner</b>. 2023. “Sellers’ Inflation, Profits and Conflict: Why Can Large Firms Hike Prices in an Emergency?” <i>Review of Keynesian Economics</i> 11 (2): 183–213. https://doi.org/10.4337/roke.2023.02.05.",sellers-inflation,https://doi.org/10.4337/roke.2023.02.05,,"The dominant view of inflation holds that it is macroeconomic in origin and must always be tackled with macroeconomic tightening. In contrast, we argue that the US COVID-19 inflation is predominantly a sellers’ inflation that derives from microeconomic origins, namely the ability of firms with market power to hike prices. Such firms are price makers, but they only engage in price hikes if they expect their competitors to do the same. This requires an implicit agreement which can be coordinated by sector-wide cost shocks and supply bottlenecks. We review the long-standing literature on price-setting in concentrated markets and survey earnings calls and compile firm-level data to derive a three-stage heuristic of the inflationary process: (1) Rising prices in systemically significant upstream sectors due to commodity market dynamics or bottlenecks create windfall profits and provide an impulse for further price hikes. (2) To protect profit margins from rising costs, downstream sectors propagate, or in cases of temporary monopolies due to bottlenecks, amplify price pressures. (3) Labor responds by trying to fend off real wage declines in the conflict stage. We argue that such sellers’ inflation generates a general price rise which may be transitory, but can also lead to self-sustaining inflationary spirals under certain conditions. Policy should aim to contain price hikes at the impulse stage to prevent inflation from the onset."
9/1/2025,"Best of times, worst of times: record fossil-fuel profits, inflation and inequality",journal_articles,Energy Research & Social Science,We document inequality in the ownership claims on record oil and gas profits in 2022 through a network model of share ownership.,"Semieniuk, Gregor, Isabella M.

Here we show the size of profits across countries and their distribution across socio-economic groups within the United States, using company income statements, comprehensive ownership data and a network model for propagating profits via shareholdings. We estimate that globally, net income in publicly listed oil and gas companies alone reached US$916 billion in 2022, with the United States the biggest beneficiary with claims on US$301 billion, more than U.S. investments of US$267 billion in the low carbon economy that year. In a network of U.S. shareholdings with 252,433 nodes including privately held U.S. companies, 50 % of profits went to the wealthiest 1 % of individuals, predominantly through direct shareholdings and private company ownership. In contrast the bottom 50 % only received 1 %. The incremental U.S. fossil-fuel profits in 2022 relative to 2021 were enough to increase the disposable income of the wealthiest Americans by several percent and compensate a substantial part of their purchasing power loss from inflation that year, thereby exacerbating inflation inequality. These profits also reinforced existing racial and ethnic inequalities and inequalities between groups with different educational attainments. We discuss how an excess profit tax could be used to both lower inequality and accelerate the energy transition as increasing geopolitical tensions and climate impacts threaten continued volatility in oil and gas markets."
9/1/2025,Implicit coordination in sellers’ inflation: How cost shocks facilitate price hikes,journal_articles,Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,"We use natural language processing and large language models on more than 130,000 earnings call transcripts to test the hypothesis that economy-wide cost shocks function as an implicit coordinating mechanism for firms to hike prices.","Weber, Isabella M., <b>Evan Wasner</b>, Markus Lang, Benjamin Braun, and Jens Van ’T Klooster. 2025. “Implicit Coordination in Sellers’ Inflation: How Cost Shocks Facilitate Price Hikes.” <i>Structural Change and Economic Dynamics</i> 74 (September): 690–712. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2025.04.005.",implicit-coordination,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2025.04.005,,"Supply shocks are now widely recognized as a driver of the recent inflation bout, but the role of firms’ pricing strategies in propagating input cost shocks remains contested. In this paper, we review the state of the academic debate over sellers’ inflation and assess whether, in line with this theory, economy-wide cost shocks have functioned as an implicit coordination mechanism for firms to hike prices. We use a dataset containing 138,962 corporate earnings call transcripts of 4,823 stock-market listed U.S. corporations from the period 2007-Q1 to 2022-Q2 to conduct sentiment analysis via both dictionary-based natural language processing and a large language model approach. We find that large input price shocks (as well as their co-occurrence with supply constraints) correlate with positive sentiments expressed in executives’ statements about cost increases. Qualitative analysis provides further insights into the reasoning behind executives’ optimism regarding their ability to turn an economy-wide cost shock into an opportunity to raise prices and protect or even increase profits."
,Why Real Wage Gains Were Not So Real: Evidence from Household-Level Food-at-Home inflation,works_in_progress,,I use NielsenIQ microdata to demonstrate that widely cited measures of real wage gains during the pandemic-era inflation likely misrepresented changes in material well-being for many U.S. households.,,real-food-wages,,,"During the pandemic-era inflation (2021-2024), widely cited measures of real wage growth suggested that the purchasing power of U.S. workers—especially low-wage workers—rose. Yet economic sentiment remained persistently negative, prompting arguments that public pessimism reflected psychology rather than material conditions. This paper provides evidence that standard CPI-deflated wage measures misrepresented changes in material well-being for many households during this period. Using NielsenIQ Consumer Panel Data (2005–2023), I construct household-specific food-at-home inflation rates and corresponding real purchasing-power measures. I find substantial dispersion in household-level food-at-home inflation, which widened sharply during the 2021-2023 inflation surge. Consequently, despite conventional measures indicating rising real food-at-home purchasing power for low-wage workers, I find that roughly 60% of households in the bottom income decile experienced declines in real food-at-home purchasing power between 2019 and 2023. I likewise document similar divergences between conventional measures and the experiences of households across the broader income distribution. These results demonstrate how aggregate CPI-deflated wage measures can misrepresent changes in material well-being, highlighting a broader measurement issue and offering a material explanation for the apparent disconnect between macroeconomic indicators and public sentiment."
,Managing Critical Input Scarcity With State Planning: The Case of the U.S. Aluminum Industry During WWII,works_in_progress,,I investigate why governments turn to unorthodox state planning tools to manage the allocation of critical inputs during times of crisis.,,ww2-planning,,,"During total war, governments often adopt unorthodox state planning tools rather than rely on uninhibited market forces to manage resource allocation, especially in sectors that produce systemically critical inputs—those essential for military production with limited short-term substitutes. This paper explores why this is the case. Drawing on classic texts on wartime planning and historical accounts of U.S. WWII mobilization, I synthesize theory explaining the limitations of market forces in facilitating the transformation to a wartime economy in critical input sectors. Time sensitivity, disincentives for private investment, inflationary risks, and the diversion of scarce resources to non-essential ends undermine the ability of market economies to meet the demands imposed by the political imperative of war mobilization, and prompt governments to rapidly develop alternative tools to manage resource allocation. Economic planning can serve as a transitional tool to expand the output of critical inputs while keeping prices stable, but imposes extraordinary logistical challenges and unintended consequences. The U.S. aluminum sector during the Second World War serves as a case study to demonstrate these arguments. Using archival material and secondary sources, I provide a chronological narrative of events that unfolded in the aluminum sector during the war, illustrating how market-driven resource allocation led to shortages and inflationary pressures, prompting mobilization planners to supplant market forces with ad hoc state planning. Policies such as price controls, rationing, and public financing were used to successfully facilitate a rapid expansion in aluminum output while maintaining price stability. I conclude by discussing the applicability of the wartime experience for a green transition, where shortages in important inputs such as critical minerals are once again a bottleneck for a rapid transition to a different national production structure."
