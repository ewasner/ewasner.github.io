7/1/2014	Spin-lasers: From threshold reduction to large-signal analysis	manuscripts	Applied Physics Letters	"We explore the theoretical effects of leveraging the properties of electron spin in lasers, demonstrating improvements over conventional counterparts."	"Jeongsu Lee, Sean Bearden, <b>Evan Wasner</b>, Igor Zutic. (2014). ""Spin-lasers: From threshold reduction to large-signal analysis."" <i>Applied Physics Letters</i>. 105 (4): 042411."	spin-lasers-threshold-reduction	https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4892071		"Lasers in which spin-polarized carriers are injected provide paths to different practical room temperature spintronic devices, not limited to magnetoresistive effects. Unlike the conventional understanding of spintronic devices, an optimal performance of such spin-lasers can arise for finite, not infinite, spin relaxation time. By considering spin-relaxation times of both electrons and holes, we elucidate advantages of spin-lasers over their conventional (spin-unpolarized) counterparts. In addition to the steady-state threshold reduction, spin-lasers can improve transient operation leading to shorter turn-on delay times, reduced ringing of emitted light, and an enhanced bandwidth."
8/27/2015	Digital operation and eye diagrams in spin-lasers	manuscripts	Applied Physics Letters	We analyze how spin-lasers improve optical communications over conventional counterparts.	"<b>Evan Wasner</b>, Sean Bearden, Jeongsu Lee, Igor Zutic. (2015). ""Digital operation and eye diagrams in spin-lasers."" <i>Applied Physics Letters</i>. 107 (8): 082406."	spin-lasers-digital-operation	https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4929612		"Digital operation of lasers with injected spin-polarized carriers provides an improved operation over their conventional counterparts with spin-unpolarized carriers. Such spin-lasers can attain much higher bit rates, crucial for optical communication systems. The overall quality of a digital signal in these two types of lasers is compared using eye diagrams and quantified by improved Q-factors and bit-error-rates in spin-lasers. Surprisingly, an optimal performance of spin-lasers requires finite, not infinite, spin-relaxation times, giving a guidance for the design of future spin-lasers."
