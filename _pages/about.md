I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research and teaching embody a pluralist and interdisciplinary approach to understanding inflation, economic coordination, and living standards, with a focus on the roles of political economy and institutions.

My current work examines how firms and households navigate inflationary environments—how supply shocks shape pricing behaviors, and how inflation heterogeneity affects real purchasing power across households. I also study historical cases of large-scale economic coordination, such as industrial planning in the United States during the Second World War, to illuminate how institutions and crises shape economic outcomes. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods, I aim to generate policy-relevant insights that connect empirical findings with the institutional and structural contexts in which economic decisions are made.

I am passionate about teaching economics as a historically grounded and empirically engaged discipline. In the classroom, I encourage students to think critically about economic arguments by comparing alternative theoretical perspectives and applying them to contemporary policy and social issues. I emphasize active, student-centered learning to help students develop the analytical and communication skills essential for understanding and engaging with today’s economic challenges.

I aim to advance the study and practice of economics through research, teaching, and engagement with pressing social and policy questions.
